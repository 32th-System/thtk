== thtkpp (c++ binding) ==

== uthdat (midnight commander extfs plugin) ==
Supports list and copyout commands.

If your midnight commander is installed without local prefix, while thtk is 
installed with one (or vice versa), you need to symlink uthdat like so:
# ln -s /usr/local/lib/mc/extfs.d/uthdat /usr/lib/mc/extfs.d/uthdat
Alternatively you might link it localy for your user like so
$ ln -s /usr/local/lib/mc/extfs.d/uthdat ~/.local/share/mc/extfs.d/uthdat

For your ext file:
regex/\.(伝|録|郷|“\`|\˜\^|‹½|DAT|dat)$
	Open=%cd %p/uthdat://
