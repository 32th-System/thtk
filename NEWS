What's new in thtk-nmlgc 6:

thmsg: Separate arguments by semicolons to interfer with text less.
thecl: Support for Uwabami Breakers has been added.
thecl: Support for the TH14 trial has been added.
thanm: Support for the TH14 trial has been added.
thmsg: Support for the TH14 web trial build (v0.01b) has been added.
       The Reitaisai release (v0.01a) uses the same format as TH13.

Furthermore, main ECL sub dumping for TH06, TH07 and TH08 has been added in the
'th06-main-sub-dump' branch. Since it still lacks a compiler and is thus pretty
useless, it is not yet available in the master branch and the binary releases.
